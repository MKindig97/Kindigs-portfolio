        I believe the most important element to any successful team is a
        balanced individual, here are a few of the actvities which keep me busy
        day to day.
      </h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Guitar Playing</h2>
        <img src="guitaristguy.jpg" alt="guitaristguy" />
        <p>
          When I'm not busy building great programs with my team, I'm hard at
          work shredding some spicy licks on my good ol stratocaster. Playing
          guitar for me is a great way to decompress; whilst at the same time
          being an awesome way of keeping your mind and fingers strong!
        </p>
        <p>
          I started playing guitar 7 years ago and I haven't put it down since!
          All it took for me to pick up my first axe was to hear my heroes on
          the radio in thier full glory. Every chord and every melody sung to my
          soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I gathered the courage to pick up the guitar and play, it wasen't
          long until I found a group of guys who shared the same passion as me.
          Even if they did not play the same instrument as me, I felt a strong
          bond for my new bandmates.
        </p>
        <p>
          These individuals gave me the reassurance that as long as you work
          together, understand the value of teamwork, you'll always know the
          feeling of accomplishment.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Skiing</h2>
        <img src="skiingguy.jpg" alt="skiing" />
        <p>
          Even though I went skiing for my first time this past year, I think
          I've found one of my new favorite hobbies! Not only is skiing a great
          way to stay in shape, but it also offers a diffrent perspective on
          what humans are capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone that has ever scaled a mountain will tell you that there is no
          greater feeling than conquering those 14er's. But, imagine adding a
          rollercoaster ride at the end of that experince. Thats basically
          skiing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing larger than life activites, such as skiing, gives people the
          confidence to overcome their mental fears by facing them head on
          physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team leader, it is important to be mindful of challenges or fears
          you may face and tackle them head on, like going down a double black
          diamond at 30 mph.
        </p>

        <h2>E-Commerce</h2>
        <img src="ecommerce.jpg" alt="ecommerce" />
        <p>
          Ever since I got out of highscool, it was always my dream to be an
          entrepenaur. The only problem was, I didn't have the knowledge,
          capital or understanding of micro and macro-econmics to get the ball
          rolling.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't until recently I discovered the power of E-Commerce; selling
          of any retail products online. Not only did this give me the experince
          of watching a business run in real time, but also gave me a better
          understanding of my customers needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started small with only a few dollars in my bank account and turned
          that into a sustaianable system where I can provide my customers an
          enjoyable shopping experince with selection, and of course making some
          passive income on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though this is a new hobbie for me, I know it will become a
          lifelong venture. When it comes to building up a successful team
          environement, it is important to ensure one is a trailblazer and
          doesn't wait for someone to give the first move; take action!
